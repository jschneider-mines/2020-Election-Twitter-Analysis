# 2020-Election-Twitter-Analysis
Project by Jared Schneider, Margaret Cayce, Karah Han, and Samson Mammarappallil. Placed on GitHub by Jared Schneider, 2021.

A project done for CSCI 402 - Database Management, in which data gathered on November 8th of 2020 from Twitter and was analyzed for potential patterns or interesting factoids.

## Topic Background (from final report)
Tweets have been an increasingly relevant method that reflects the current state of mind of anyone, from news outlets, to individuals, to Presidents  themselves. Thus, we determined that analysis of candidate-related tweets would yield relevant and insightful results.

The breadth of information provided in our dataset would allow us to analyze trends across multiple factors. Although there were so many directions we could take this project, after discussion, we landed on the issue of bots on Twitter. 

A Twitter bot is an implementation of robot software that uses an account via the Twitter API [1]. Some bots are harmless; for example, there are bots commissioned by government agencies that  tweet urgent information about natural disasters or inclement weather. However, there are many concerns about the negative influence of Twitter bots on news and reporting on current events.

## Data Overview (from final report)
The data we chose, entitled “US Election 2020 tweets”, consists of two datasets and includes over 1.7 million tweets. The two datasets each contain 21 columns detailing the information of each tweet posted around Election Day in 2020. Each row features a single tweet. One .csv file holds information about every tweet with the hashtag “#joebiden” and the other .csv file holds information for the hashtag “#donaldtrump”. The datasets were comparable in size.

We organized the data into these categories: creation date, tweet content, tweet likes, retweet count, author's username, author's screen name, author's bio (aka description), author's join date (account creation date), author's follower count, author's location, country, continent, and state code.
